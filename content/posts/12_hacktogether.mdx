### Our Idea

This past weekend, I attended <a className="link" href="https://reacttogether.dev/" target="_blank">Hack Together</a>, a Hackathon in Lisbon. There, together with my team, I built <a className="link" href="https://scratch-map.pages.dev/" target="_blank">Scratch Map</a>: a collaborative map tool that lets users easily add notes to a shared canvas and plan events or activities with friends. The app is designed to be lightweight and easy to set up; users simply open the link and get a generated link or QR code to share with others. Once shared, everyone can add, edit, and view notes in real-time, creating a dynamic and interactive map experience.

        {type: "image", src:"/assets/scratchmap1.jpg", caption:"Add multiple places to the map at once"} 
    ]}
/>

We designed Scratch Map to be like a “Snapchat for maps,” allowing people to create collaborative maps that are almost disposable, making it easy to brainstorm plans, map out locations, or just share ideas in a fun, visual way. The app keeps all devices connected in sync, so as users add notes, they instantly appear on everyone&#39;s screen.

For a 24-hour hackathon, I&#39;m really happy with what we achieved. The core functionality is there &#40;you can try it out already <a className="link" href="https://scratch-map.pages.dev/" target="_blank">here</a>&#41;, and I&#39;m considering refining it and releasing it on Product Hunt. Here&#39;s a glimpse of some features I&#39;d love to add:

- Ability to attach images or videos to map markers
- Message threads within each note for extended conversations
- Session-based chat for real-time discussions
- Various other quality-of-life improvements to make it even more user-friendly

### How it was

Last time I attended a Hackathon, I went together with three other people that I already knew. This time, I went solo, without a team &#40;it was a bit scary&#41;. I made sure I arrived early so I could connect with a few other solo participants, and luckily it worked. I had a blast meeting and working with these people. Here&#39;s a photo of us on the second day of the event:

</div>

Turns out, we really worked well together: we ended up receiving second place at the event. It&#39;s always really nice when stuff like this just works out. I&#39;m already looking for my next hackathon.
