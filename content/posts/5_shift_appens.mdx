Last week I participated in a hackathon in my hometown, Coimbra, called <a className="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/shiftappens/" target="_blank">Shift Appens</a>. I teamed up with some friends, and we ended up winning! It was an incredible experience: all of my teammates were far more experienced programmers than I am, so I learned a lot.
Before the event, we knew we wanted to work with React Native, so I actually spent the full week prior to the event learning it to make sure I could be useful. I liked it, and will definitely build more things with it.

Here's the four of us, plus the organisers of the event and the guy that handed us the prize:

### What we did

Our project was very simple: turn text documents into quizzes, using AI. We managed to fully implement this functionality, and I'm really proud of what we achieved. I truly think we did a great job in all criterias that the judges used to choose the winners: design, concept, code and pitch.
Here's a demo of the app (there's no audio, we did the pitch live while the video was playing):
