title: Building a spotify controlling device
description: I used spotify's API together with some hardware components to build a device that can change volume, skip/back, pause/play and like/dislike songs. It was my introduction to the world of embedded systems.

A year ago I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWiPIBWvgIU\&t=2s" target="_blank" className="link">this</a> video and I thought it would be an interesting experience to build a similar device. I basically never did anything related to embedded systems before, so I had a lot to learn.  
I spent last week on vacation with my family, and together with my cousin Alex, I finally got to build the device.  
With the advice I got, I ended up using a bunch of different components than the ones shown in the video, which resulted in having to change up a bit more of the code, and helped me understand how to wire stuff up and all that: instead of the esp8266, I used an esp32. Other than that, I used a breadboard instead of a perfboard, and I didn’t use a display at all.  
Here’s some pictures and videos of how it turned out:

    ]
    }

### Takeaways

I really really really liked this project. Ever since coming back home from vacation, I've found myself looking for hardware components that I can somehow incorporate in a specific project. My youtube recommendations are full of arduino projects and stuff like that. Turns out, eletronics, microcontrollers and all that stuff, are actually really cool.
