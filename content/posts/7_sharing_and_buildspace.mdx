Around a month ago, I got news that I was part of buildspace's nights & weekends s5. This is a six weeks long period of time where you're encouraged to build something you're interested in, no matter the topic, and really commit to it. Every week there's two livestreams with interesting insight in order to provide direction. I've been having a lot of fun and learning a lot about bringing ideas to life with the guys from buildspace. 
It's been three weeks since it actually started. Here's what I've done so far:
### Week 1:
On week 1 I was told to define what I wanted to build. I was tasked with coming up with a one liner for my idea, and a simple description of what it was going to be. Here's what I did:
<img className="border-2 border-border rounded-md" src="/assets/nw1.jpg" width="768" alt="My idea for buildspace's n&w." />

### Week 2:
Now, for week 2, the task was to build a toy version of my idea. This just meant that I had to post some very rough draft of what I was working on. I came up with this video (also check my <a className="link" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/achichorroc/status/1808180518883566010">tweet</a> about it if you want):

        <source src="/assets/buildspace_w2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

### Week 3:
And with that, it's now week 3. In week 3, I was tasked with finding the first ten people that care about what I'm doing. In specific, <a href="https://x.com/FarzaTV" target="_blank" className="link">Farza</a>, the guy that is both the CEO of buildspace and leads the livestreams each week, had this whole spiel about how we all build for each other, and if we're working on our ideas, the whole point of all of it is to share it with people who care. Whether you're a musician, or an engineer, or a salesperson, or a painer, you'll want people listening to your music, using your machines, buying your product, interacting with your art. This really struck a chord with me.

### Thoughts on sharing what I do

I realised I haven't been sharing anything of what I do. This past year, I took a gap year, and I spent it mostly learning how to code, and doing projects that I thought were cool. I even built this website, and this is already my 7th post. Regardless of that, I never actually shared what I'm doing with anyone, except some family members and close friends. At the same time, I've been discovering that I crave this sense of community, and I like that people know about what I'm doing! I've just been too scared, of not putting out stuff that's good enough, or different enough, or whatever enough. And scared of people thinking that what I'm doing is stupid, and I'm wasting my time. 

### Buildspace week 3 submission

What I've been working on for buildspace is really just a personal project. I've been playing a lot of basketball, specifically shooting a lot, and I want data on that. I also haven't really done anything with machine learning, so I thought it'd be a good opportunity to start and learn. 
This project is a lot like most of the stuff I've done this year. I've tried to do something while learning something new. And I think all of it was cool, so maybe other people will as well.

I spent week 3 of buildspace touching up this website project that I started at the beginning of the year. Here I talk about some of the stuff I've been up to. Maybe other people will think it's cool too. My goal is to find those that care.

If you've read up to this point and you care, let me know! I'll be trying to share more of what I do.
